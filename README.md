## Overview
The LangChain RAG AI project is designed to assist students in answering questions based on a textbook provided by the teacher in the Algorithms and Automata class. This project leverages LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to enhance the process of answering questions by providing contextually relevant information from the book.

Purpose
This project was developed as a part of the Algorithms and Automata class to help students efficiently retrieve and understand information from a provided textbook. It uses advanced AI techniques to deliver accurate and contextually relevant answers to questions, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the material.

Features
Contextual Question Answering: Provides answers to questions based on the content of the textbook.
Dynamic Retrieval: Uses retrieval techniques to extract relevant information from the text.
LangChain Integration: Implements LangChain for managing and processing the text data.
